# Lunar Lander

## Description

This is a web based game of my version of the Atari game Lunar Lander from 1979.
A random terrain is generated with each new game, and the Player begins with a
set ammount of fuel to manueveur the ship.

The goal of the game is to land the space ship in a designated safe area.
There are two levels, level one has two safe zones with a larger surface area.
The second level has only one safe zone with a smaller surface area.

In order to land safely, the user must satisfy the following:
* Safe Speed
* Safe Angle
* Land in safe area
